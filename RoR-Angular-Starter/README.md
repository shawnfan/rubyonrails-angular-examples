## RubyOnRails + Angular Template

Recently I've been working on quite a few angular mockup. Everything I need to spend that extra 15 - 30 mins to setup everything. 

Why not just do it easily with a starter kit.

I know a lot people probabaly has done this, but using my own setup is probably easiest to follow and reuse.
